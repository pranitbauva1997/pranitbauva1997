  I am a Software Engineer and a strong believer in the power of compounding. With a growth mindset I keep pondering about <b>"How fast do I double?" day in and day out</b>.
</p>
<p align="center">
Oh and I am not just interested in doubling my money, if that's what you are thinking. I am more interested in doubling my knowledge, skill set, experience & network.

<div align="center">

    <li> The over-arching theme for my portfolio is financials as I believe that financial firms (providers of the scare capital) are one of the growth engines of emerging markets. </li>
