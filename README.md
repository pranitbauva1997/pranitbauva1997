  I am a Software Engineer and a strong believer in the power of compounding. With a growth mindset I keep pondering about <b>"How fast do I double?"</b> day in and day out.

<p align="center">
Oh and I am not just interested in doubling my money, if that's what you are thinking. I am more interested in doubling my knowledge, skill set, experience & network.

### What I am doing as a software engineer?
 - I am writing Elm for writing frontend and [I have never been this happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOCx0QeQ5c)
 -  I am writing Rust for backend and let the compiler do it's thing

### What I am doing as an investor?
 - I read Annual Reports & Quarterly Reports to keep a track of what my portfolio companies and their competitors are doing
 - The over-arching theme for my portfolio is financials as I believe that financial firms (dealers of the scarce resource) are one of the growth engines of emerging markets.
