I am the founder of <a href="https://nirah.app">Nirah</a>. Nirah helps
technology companies deliver and process real-time webhooks reliably
with great concern for security and privacy. While working at Setu,
I discovered sending and processing webhooks to be a painful
exercise which is a crucial component of our systems to deliver
information to customers and wished that this would be taken cared
of by someone else. I now help such companies to focus on building
their core competitive advantage and outsource webhooks parts to Nirah.

I have built the <a href="https://docs.setu.co/data/bav/reverse-penny-drop/quickstart">
Reverse Penny Drop</a> product for Setu which can fetch account number and
IFSC by making a refundable Rs. 1 payment using UPI, helped it find
product-market fit by talking to users to understand their workflows
and pain points, and made it the highest margin product of Setu.

I have built the chatbot for handling customer support tickets to help
Carousell transition from Zendesk and thus implement custom journeys
as required by business and also enable significant cost savings.
