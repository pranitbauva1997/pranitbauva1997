I am an engineer and an investor.

I attempted to do a startup in the past to work on webhooks, find more details
here: [Annual Report FY23-24](/annual-reports/annual-report-fy23-24).

I have built the
[Reverse Penny Drop](https://docs.setu.co/data/bav/reverse-penny-drop/quickstart)
product for Setu which can fetch account number and
IFSC by making a refundable Rs. 1 payment using UPI, helped it find
product-market fit by talking to users to understand their workflows
and pain points, and made it the highest margin product of Setu. Find
more details here: [Annual Report FY22-23](/annual-reports/annual-report-fy22-23).

I have built the [chatbot](https://support.carousell.com/hc/en-us) for handling
customer support tickets to help
Carousell transition from Zendesk and thus implement custom journeys
as required by business and also enable significant cost savings.
It has 50,000 daily users. Find more details here:

### What I am doing as an engineer?

I am building projects that help me automate a part of my life.

### What I am doing as an investor?
 - I read Annual Reports & Quarterly Reports to keep a track of what my
   portfolio companies and their competitors are doing
 - The over-arching theme for my portfolio is financials as I believe
   that financial firms (dealers of the scarce resource) are one of the
   growth engines of emerging markets
 - I exclusively invest in publicly listed companies
